            <p>Baxcalibur's high Attack stat and strong STAB attacks put it among the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Swords Dance accentuates its power, allowing Baxcalibur to OHKO faster threats such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon with Ice Shard, as well as OHKOing defensive Great Tusk with Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage. Loaded Dice + Icicle Spear affords Baxcalibur a strong and accurate STAB move. Another option for Baxcalibur is Heavy-Duty Boots, which removes its weakness to Stealth Rock at the cost of making it use the slightly weaker Icicle Crash. Icicle Crash also has merit, however, as it gives Baxcalibur a chance to flinch down its checks like Iron Defense Corviknight. Tera Dragon allows Baxcalibur to gain a Fire resistance, notably helping it check Volcarona. Additionally, Tera Dragon boosts the power of Glaive Rush, allowing +2 Baxcalibur to OHKO physically defensive Toxapex. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a defensive option to avoid being revenge killed by threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit. Thermal Exchange is the preferred ability to prevent burns, letting Baxcalibur set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W.

            <p>Swords Dance Baxcalibur works best on hyper offense teams, where it can wallbreak effectively to facilitate sweeps for other offensive Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Moth and Iron Valiant. Teammates such as offensive Great Tusk, Meowscarada, and Glimmora can set entry hazards to help pressure Baxcalibur checks such as Azumarill and Dondozo. Kingambit provides a switch-in to Dragapult and helps overwhelm shared checks like Dondozo. Volcarona appreciates Baxcalibur's efforts in wearing down Skeledirge and checks Iron Valiant. Baxcalibur is vulnerable to hazards if running Loaded Dice, so it appreciates hazard removal from Iron Treads and Great Tusk. Swords Dance Baxcalibur also appreciates Sticky Web support from Masquerain, as this allows it to outspeed revenge killers such as Hisuian Zoroark, non-Booster Energy Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.
